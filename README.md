<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<p>Welcome to Homer's Casino BlackJack! Here are the rules for the game!</p>

1. New game deals 2 cards to the dealer and the player.

2. Points totaling 21 win the game.

3. If neither the dealer or the player has a total of 21, the person with total closest to 21 wins.

4. Hit will add an additional card to your hand. As long as your total is under 21, you can continue to hit as many times as you want. As soon as you hit over 21, you lose.

5. Stand keeps your hand and total. Once you stand, hitting is prohibited for the rest of the round. The dealer will automatically hit himself if player stand.

6. Homer is still new to BlackJack, so in this casino Ace's are worth 11 points and Jack, Queen, Kings are worth 10.

7. Best of luck! Have fun!


<h4>Future Enhancements:</h4>

1. Currently all cards and suits are displayed as black. Next update should have diamonds and hearts as red to provide for a more realistic experience. 

2. There may still be some minor bugs depending on the conditional route the player takes. If there are bugs, please report them and we will be sure to add it to the next update.
