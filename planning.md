Write 52 cards with suits.
Define the numbers of cards
Define the value of the cards (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A)
Create 1 dealer, 1 player.
Let dealer deal 2 random cards to himself, 1 hidden from player, 1 showing.
Let dealer deal 2 random cards to player.
If the value of the cards are more than 21 dealer/player busts/loses
If the value of the cards are less than 21, dealer/player has the choice of hitting, adds another card.
No repeat cards.

If both dealer and player stay, then dealer will reveal the hidden cards. Whoever has 21 or has the closest number to 21 will win the game.
